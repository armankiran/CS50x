    <p><span class="p-beginning">Coffee</span> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
      berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to
      produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them
      into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot
      water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>
    <p><span class="p-beginning">Coffee</span> is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect
      in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be
      prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned
      coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or
      cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or
      another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as
      a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).</p>
    <p><span class="p-beginning">Clinical</span> research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly
      beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the
      risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable credibility.</p>
    <p><span class="p-beginning">The earliest</span> credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of the
      modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee
      seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans
      from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the
      drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.</p>

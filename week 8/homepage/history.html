        <p><span class="p-beginning">The earliest</span> credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee
            tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.
            It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared
            now.
            Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin of
            the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen.
            From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea. One account credits
            Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast.
            Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to
            Arabia. According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal king
            Sadadin's companions in 1401.
            Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings a beverage called qahwa
            developed from a tree in the Zeila region. Coffee was first exported from Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali
            merchants from Berbera and Zeila in modern-day Somaliland, which was procured from Harar and the Abyssinian
            interior.
            According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839â€“1854), Mocha historically
            imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera-based merchants before the coffee trade of Mocha was
            captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. Thereafter, much of the Ethiopian coffee was
            exported to Aden via Berbera.</p>
        <p><span class="p-beginning">By the 16th century,</span> coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia,
            Turkey, and northern Africa. The first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the Middle East by Sufi Baba Budan
            from Yemen to the Indian subcontinent during the time. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or
            otherwise sterilised.
            Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The
            first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore.
            Coffee had spread to Italy by 1600, and then to the rest of Europe, Indonesia, and the Americas.</p>

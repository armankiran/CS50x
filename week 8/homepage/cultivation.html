    <p><span class="p-beginning">The traditional</span> method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at
      the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to
      sprout.
      A more effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then
      planted outside at six to twelve months.
      Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of
      cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements.
      Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or
      coffee belt.</p>
    <p><span class="p-beginning">Of the two main species grown,</span> arabica coffee (from C. arabica) is generally
      more highly regarded than robusta coffee (from C. canephora). Robusta coffee tends to be bitter and have less
      flavor but better body than arabica.
      For these reasons, about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica. Robusta strains also contain
      about 40â€“50% more caffeine than arabica.
      Consequently, this species is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends.
      Good quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste and a
      better foam head (known as crema).</p>
    <p><span class="p-beginning">Mycena</span> citricolor is another threat to coffee plants, primarily in Latin
      America. Mycena citricolor, commonly referred to as American Leaf Spot, is a fungus that can affect the whole
      coffee plant.
      It can grow on leaves, resulting in leaves with holes that often fall from the plant.</p>
